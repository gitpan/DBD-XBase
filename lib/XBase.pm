XBase - Perl module for reading and writing the dbf files

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use XBase;
	my $table = new XBase("dbase.dbf");
	for (0 .. $table->last_record())
		{
		my ($deleted, $id, $msg)
			= $table->get_record($_, "ID", "MSG");
		print "$id:\t$msg\n" unless $deleted;
		}

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module can read and write XBase database file, known as dbf in
dBase and FoxPro world. It also reads memo (and the like) fields from
the dbt files, if needed. This module should really be used via
DBD::XBase DBI driver, but this is the alternative interface.
Note for now: no real DBD:: support currently exists.

Remember: Since the version number is pretty low now, you might want
to check the CHANGES file any time you upgrade to see wheather some of
the features you use haven't disappeared.

WARNING for now: It doesn't support any index files at the present
time! That means if you change your dbf, your idx&mdx (if you have
any) will not match. So do not do that.

The following methods are supported:

=head2 General methods

=over 4

=item new

Creates the XBase object, takes the file's name as argument, parses
the file's header, fills the data structures.

=item close

Closes the object/file.

=item create

Creates new database file. Expects class name and hash of options,
containing at least B<name> and references to lists B<field_names>,
B<field_types>, B<field_lengths> and B<field_decimals>.

You can also pass reference to XBase object instead of class name (and
then can omit the other field_* attributes) and the new table will
have the same structure (fields) as the original object.

BUG: currently will not create .dbt file for you.

=item last_record

Number of the last record in the file. The lines deleted but present
in the file are included in this number.

=item last_field

Number of the last field in the file, number of fields minus 1.

=item field_names, field_types, field_lengths, field_decimals

List of field names and so for the dbf file.

=back

When dealing with the records, you always have to specify the number
of the record in the file. The range is 0 .. $table->last_record().

=head2 Reading the data

=over 4

=item get_record

Returns a list of data from the specified record (line of the table).
The first argument is the number of the record. If there are any other
arguments, they are considered to be the names of the fields and only
the specified fields are returned. If no field names are present,
returns all fields in the record. The first value of the returned list
is the 1/0 value saying if the record is deleted or not.

=item get_record_as_hash

Returns hash (in list context) or reference to hash (scalar), where
keys are the field names of the record and values the values. The
deleted flag has name _DELETED.

=back

=head2 Writing the data

=over 4

=item set_record

As arguments, takes the number of the record and the list of values
of the fields. It writes the record to the file. Unspecified fields
(if you pass less than you should) are set to undef/empty. The record
is undeleted.

=item set_record_hash

Takes number of the record and hash, sets the fields, unspecified are
undeffed/emptied. The record is undeleted.

=item update_record_hash

Like B<write_record_hash> but preserves fields that do not have value
specified in the hash. The record is undeleted.

=item delete_record, undelete record

Deletes/undeletes the record.

=back

=head2 Errors and debugging

If the method fails (returns undef of null list), the error message
can be retrieved via B<errstr> method. If the B<new> method fails, you
have no object and so B<new> (and only B<new>) puts the error message
into the $XBase::errstr variable.

The methods B<get_header_info> and B<dump_records> can be used to
quickly view the content of the file, at least for now. Please speak
up if you like them and want them to be supported. They are here
mainly for my debugging purposes.

Module XBase::Base(3) defines some basic functionality and also following
variables, that affect the internal behaviour:

=over 4

=item $DEBUG

Enables error messages on stderr.

=item $FIXPROBLEMS

When reading the file, try to continue, even if there is some
(minor) missmatch in the data.

=back

In the module XBase there is variable $CLEARNULLS which if true, will
make the reading methods cuts off spaces and nulls from the end of
character fields on read.

=head1 LITTLE EXAMPLE

This is a code to update field MSG in record where ID is 123.

	use XBase;
	my $table = new XBase("test.dbf");
	die $XBase::errstr unless defined $table;
	for (0 .. $table->last_record())
		{
		my ($deleted, $id)
			= $table->get_record($_, "ID");
		die $table->errstr unless defined $deleted;
		next if $deleted;
		if ($id == 123)
			{
			$table->update_record_hash($_,
				"MSG" => "New message");
			last;
			}
		}

=head1 MEMO FIELDS and INDEX FILES

If there is a memo field in the dbf file, the module tries to open
file with the same name but extension .dbt. It uses module
XBase::Memo(3) for this. It reads and writes this memo field
transparently (ie you do not know about it).

Quiz question: can there be more than one memo field in the dbf file?
In what file (.dbt?) should I search for their values? Any ideas?

No index files are currently supported. Two reasons: you do not need
them when reading the file because you specify the record number
anyway and writing them is extremely difficult. I will try to add the
support but do not promise anything ;-) There are too many too complex
questions: how about compound indexes? Which index formats should
I support? What files contain the index data? I do not have dBase nor
Fox* so do not have data to experiment. Send me anything that might
help.

Any ideas, suggestions, URLs, help or code? Please write me, I am
writing this module for you.

=head1 INTERFACE

Would you like different interface in the module? Write me, we shall
figure something out.

=head1 HISTORY

I have been using the Xbase(3) module by Pratap Pereira for quite
a time to read the dbf files, but it had no writing capabilities, it
was not C<use strict> clean and the author did not support the
module behind the version 1.07. So I started to make my own patches
and thought it would be nice if other people could make use of them.
I thought about taking over the development of the original Xbase
package, but the interface seemed rather complicated to me and I also
disliked the licence Pratap had about the module.

So with the help of article XBase File Format Description by Erik
Bachmann, URL http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Pines/2563/xbase.htm,
I have written a new module. It doesn't use any code from Xbase-1.07
and you are free to use and distribute it under the same terms as Perl
itself.

Please send all bug reports CC'ed to my e-mail, since I might miss
your post in c.l.p.misc or dbi-users (or other groups). Any comments
from both Perl and XBase gurus are welcome, since I do neither use
dBase nor Fox*, so there are probably pieces missing.
