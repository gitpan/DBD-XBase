This is README file for the DBD::XBase package. Please note that this
is a new module, so the doc need more polishing and it will be coming
briefly. I only release this version (0.024) because quite a lot of
people seemed interested in the module.

Install: download the tar.gz, unpack it, change to the DBD-XBase-*
directory. Then do

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make install

The man page XBase(3) is included.

Briefly, what is this about? This module should replace the Xbase-1.07
module, the main change are the added writing capabilities. The
package that actualy deals with the data files, is XBase. DBD::XBase
is intended DBD::* interface but it does not exist yet.

There are no tests in this version and that is definitely to be
considered a bug. It will be fixed but if you send me a nice scripts,
I will be glad to put them into the t directory.

And yes, this is alpha software. I will be glad to hear about you
testing it and I will try to fix any bugs and add new features but
please, test it on a backup copy of your data. The more tests we do
now, the sooner we can feel the module is safe and usable.
