This is the to-do list for XBase and DBD::XBase package:


Short term (I will do them as my time allows):

	Finish DBD::XBase (pretty close now).


Mid term (would appreciate help or comments):

	Locking -- will probably lock all the whole file when creating
	the XBase object and unlock it upon close.


Long term (it really depends on many things, mainly whether other
people will demand the feature):

	Indexing: how should this work? Am I able to rewrite _all_ the
	indexing algorithms around from all the versions of dBase,
	FoxBase, FoxPro, Clipper, some, some other?

	I'm now working on some cdx parser but do not see any real use
	for that just now.
