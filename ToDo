This is the to-do list for package XBase and DBD::XBase:

Short term (I will do them):

	Create XBase should also create necessary memo files.

	Review error messages.

	Tests for create.

	Create should not allow overwriting existing file, so we
	probably need drop.

Mid term (would appreciate help or comments):

	DBD::XBase -- just not I am stuck because I do not know how to
	(for example) get dsn data inside prepare.

	Locking -- will probably lock the whole file when starting
	some operation. This way however, the select (or so) will not
	be atomic unleess we read all the data upon execute and not
	on fetchrow.


Long term (it really depends on many things):

	Indexing: how should this work? Am I able to rewrite _all_ the
	indexing algorithms around from all the versions of dBase,
	FoxBase, FoxPro, Clipper, some, some other?
