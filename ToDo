This is the to-do list for package XBase and DBD::XBase:

Short term (I will do them):

	Review error messages.

	DBD::XBase -- I'm now working on some siiimple SQL parser.

Mid term (would appreciate help or comments):

	Locking -- will probably lock all the whole file when creating
	the XBase object and unlock it upon close.


Long term (it really depends on many things):

	Indexing: how should this work? Am I able to rewrite _all_ the
	indexing algorithms around from all the versions of dBase,
	FoxBase, FoxPro, Clipper, some, some other?

	I'm now working on some cdx parser but do not see any real use
	for that just now.
