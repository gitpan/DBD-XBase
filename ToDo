This is the to-do list for the XBase and DBD::XBase packages:

Short term (I will do them as my time allows):

	When creating table, have option to specify version.

	Add support for MDX, CDX and IDX.

Mid term (would appreciate help or comments):

	Add sorting on more than one field in DBD.

	Solve the memo position caching.

	Polish error reporting from XBase::Index.

Long term (it really depends on many things, mainly whether other
people will demand the feature):

	Add index support to DBD::XBase (once we have MDX, probably).

	Add write index support.
