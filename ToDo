This is the to-do list for the XBase and DBD::XBase packages:

Short term (I will do them as my time allows):

	Solve the memo position caching.

Mid term (would appreciate help or comments):

	Start work on ndx index type.

	Check DBD::XBase, make it DBI 0.93 compliant.

Long term (it really depends on many things, mainly whether other
people will demand the feature):

	Indexing.
