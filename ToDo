This is the to-do list for the XBase and DBD::XBase packages:

Short term (I will do them as my time allows):

	Improve write index support.

	Date cdx and dbf bug reports by Dan Albertsson (1999/05/12).

	Handling large cdx files, patch provided by Jon Bloom (1999/08/04).

	Bug report and patch for ntx by Maksim Bazhanov (1999/11/09).

	Bug report (undefined value) by Jose L. Ornelas pending
	(1999/12/16).

	Bug report and patch for ntx by Sergey Wasiliew pending
	(2000/01/05).

	Gregory McCann reports (2000/01/13) that the Visual FoxPro v6
	dbf file leads to Can't use string ("") as a subroutine ref
	while "strict refs" in use warning. I'd need a test file
	for that (provided the 0.160 patch for _NULLFLAGS didn't fix
	it, in which case I'd still appreciate some ideas of what
	that type means).

	The cdx parsing is still not exactly correct -- Carlos H. Lopez
	reports (2000/02/07) different number of records than
	XBase::Index finds for big (50k records) files.

Mid term (would appreciate help or comments):

	Need to fix handling attributes in DBD ...

	When creating table, have option to specify version.

	Finish write index support.

	Add sorting on more than one field in DBD.

	Polish error reporting from XBase::Index.

Long term (it really depends on many things, mainly whether other
people will demand the feature, offer help):

	Add index support to DBD::XBase (once it's stable in XBase.pm).

	Add memo position caching.

	Some support for LIMIT SQL clause, perhaps.
