---

Note: Versions tagged (*****) were major updates and code changes.

I have been using the Xbase(3) module by Pratap Pereira for quite
a time to read the dbf files, but it had no writing capabilities, it
was not use strict clean and the author did not support the module
behind the version 1.07. So I started to make my own patches and
thought it would be nice if other people could make use of them.
I thought about taking over the development of the original Xbase
package, but the interface seemed rather complicated to me.

So with the help of article XBase File Format Description by Erik
Bachmann on URL

	http://www.e-bachmann.dk/docs/xbase.htm

I have written a new module. It doesn't use any code from Xbase-1.07
and you are free to use and distribute it under the same terms as Perl
itself.
