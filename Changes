Revision history for Perl extension XBase and DBD::Xbase.

0.0632 Wed May 27 12:27:04 MET DST 1998

	Added --nomemo option to dbfdump. The list of entires is made
	longer in any non-leaf page in ndx. Added check for the magic
	"FFFF0800" tag in dBaseIV dbt file when reading it.

0.0631 Fri May 22 22:24:02 CEST 1998

	Fixed handling big endian in numeric fields in ndx, fixe
	problem with key/record	length.

0.063 Sun May 17 21:46:08 CEST 1998

	Added first support for ndx index files. From XBase module
	it's available using prepare_select_with_index.	It's very
	alpha but it seems to handle character and numeric (not date
	yet) types. And yes, it's read only.

	Added FETCH('NAME') and _ListTables to DBD::XBase, added drop
	table, integer type and dummy not null to XBase::SQL. The
	generic DBI test suite now goes well up until bind params, put
	on ToDo list.

0.062 Thu May 14 15:11:32 MET DST 1998

	Field and table names in XBase::SQL now accept digits and
	underscores, in XBase::Memo, we check for
	($dbf_version & 15), patches by Jens Quade.

	Fixed handling of Fox* fpt files and a problem with memo
	files that have record length different than 512, patches
	by Thomas Grueter.

0.061 Tue Apr  7 21:52:07 MET DST 1998

	Fixed writing undefined values in numeric fields.
	Fixed dealing with uppercase extensions.

	XBase::SQL fixed to support int, found by Chris Winters.

	Offset in the record headers in dbf now set properly, patch by
	Dave Frascone.

	Added ignorememo option to new XBase call. Use this if you
	have a memo field in dbt but do not have the memo file.
	Otherwise you will get an error, request by Martin Jost.
	Other fixes by Martin Jost included.

0.060 Fri Mar 20 10:20:45 MET 1998

	Added method prepare_select and XBase::Cursor to implement
	long selects. Method dump_records now prints directly,
	doesn't use get_all_records.

	Added parameter --info into the script dbfdump to print the
	header info.

	Changed way of determining the type of the dbt file after
	discussion with Sergey Lukashevich.
	
0.0599 Wed Mar 11 22:58:45 MET 1998

	Option to specify the memo file in call to XBase::new added.

	Dump_records made customizable.

0.0598 Tue Mar 10 22:40:00 MET 1998

	Fixed bug when finding a name for the memo file in XBase; in
	dBaseIII memo field we will only check for one \x1a to allow
	as many formats possible, we still write two of them; typo in
	init_memo fixed -- patches by Martin Jost.

0.0597 Tue Mar  3 23:40:56 MET 1998		(*****)

	Almeida.

0.058 Mon Feb  9 19:15:03 MET 1998		(*****)

	XBase::SQL rewritten, DBD::XBase now supports select, delete,
	insert, update and create table. Documentation for DBD::XBase
	extended. DBD::XBase is still alpha, now my effort will go to
	support everything that DBI 0.92 requires.

	Added support for fpt memo files.

	Fixed bug with dBase IV memo files, the block length is stored
	somewhere else, patch by James LewisMoss. Fixed bug with field
	names in newer dbf files, terminated by zero byte, patch by Petr
	Olsak. Added binmode for the OSes that write to disk something
	else that they are told to, reported by Robert Bauer. Removed
	the test that caused read to fail on read-only files, reported
	by Stewart Russell.

	The error handling reviewed, most of the error messages are
	now local to the object ($table->errstr()).
