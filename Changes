Revision history for Perl extension XBase and DBD::Xbase.

0.024 Mon Oct 20 22:17:44 MET DST 1997

	The original release. Includes XBase that reads dbf and dbt
	and writes dbf (but not dbt ;-) Put on CPAN mainly for other
	people to test and comment on it.

	Bug fixes. Added methods for writing dbt files.

	The writing methods are now set_record, set_record_hash and
	update_record. Any comments?

	Minor bug fixes. XBase::create added. Tests extended. Module
	released on CPAN.
	
	I have worked on DBD::XBase module a little but it's still now
	usable.
